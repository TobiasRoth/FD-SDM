# METHODS


## Study Area

We worked in a **beautiful** place with lots of trees, like *Quercus suber* and *Laurus nobilis*.


## Data collection and analysis

```{r read_data, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
dataset <- read.csv("mydata.csv")
```

We applied a linear model where

$$
y_{i} = \alpha + \beta*x_{i} 
$$

```{r model, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
model <- lm(y ~ x)
```

We used the statistical language `R` `r citep(citation())` for all our analyses. These were implemented in dynamic rmarkdown documents using `knitr` `r citep(citation("knitr"))` and `rmarkdown` `r citep(citation("rmarkdown"))` packages. All the multilevel models were fitted with `lme4` `r citep(citation("lme4"))`.
